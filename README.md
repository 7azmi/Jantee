# Jantee

Jantee is an advanced Telegram chatbot specifically crafted to inspire and manage daily pushup routines within Telegram groups. Leveraging AI technology, Jantee accurately counts pushups from user-submitted video notes, ensuring that each group member remains committed to their fitness objectives.

## How it works

- **Setting Goals and Punishments:** Group members decide on a daily pushup target (e.g., 50 pushups) and a consequent punishment for non-compliance (e.g., a fine contributed to charity).
- **Monitoring and Management:** As a group admin, Jantee monitors messages, updates users on their progress, and enforces discipline by removing members who fail to meet the pushup target for three consecutive days.
- **User Engagement:** Each player in the group interacts with Jantee to track their progress and stay motivated.
