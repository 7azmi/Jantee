# Lucy
Lucy is an innovative Telegram chatbot designed to motivate, track, and manage daily pushup routines within a Telegram group. It uses AI to count pushups from user-submitted videos and ensures that group members stay on track with their fitness goals.

## In a nutshell

## How it works
* First, participants must agree on a daily pushup count, say 50 a day, and a punishment. If anyone does not do 50 pushups today, then he must be punished. E.g. RM5 to Charity.
* As a group admin, Lucy reads messages, informs users about their progress, and ruthlessly kicks out the lazy members who miss three days of pushups in a row.
* Every player
